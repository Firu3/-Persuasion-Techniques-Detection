 this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study focused on identifying persuasive techniques in Arabic social
 media content. To achieve this objective, we utilize Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and leverage the
 ArAlEval dataset, which encompasses two tasks: binary classification to determine the presence or absence
 of persuasion techniques, and multi-label classification to identify the specific types of techniques employed
 in the text. Our study explores three different learning approaches by harnessing the power of PLMs: feature
 extraction, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering techniques.
